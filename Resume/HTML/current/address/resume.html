This automated system included report delivery via FTP or e-mail attachment, notification of report delivery via e-mail, and archiving the reports and associated metadata via PL/SQL functions to a web portal server for historical retrieval. The automation of report generation and delivery occurred weekly, monthly, and quarterly.</li>
        <li>Implemented a royalty system based in OO Perl that extracted all digital media plays (audio/video media types, purchase/computer/portable plays) from a data warehouse to calculate costs and then generate the royalty bearing financial figures, per licensor, based on a complex system of financial dependencies contractually outlined by each licensor.</li>
        <li>Implemented a billing system for digital media purchases, new account signups, and batch systems for both subscription renewals and billing period ending dates. This billing system included credit card, debit card, and checking account based transactions.
